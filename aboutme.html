    <p>There are people who cannot find a second love, after their first, great one. I like this movie mainly it's some what replica of my first crush. <br> The way he goes back to visit his high school, the first thing he does is sit on his old bench. And keeping the old memories of his crush.<br> Showing purity of love to his crush after marriage. All these scenes are potraited excellent.</p>
